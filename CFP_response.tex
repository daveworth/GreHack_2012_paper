%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does

% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

%\boldmath
Static analysis in dynamic languages is a well known difficult problem in computer
science, with a great deal of emphasis being put on type
inference\cite{Furr:2009:STI:1529282.1529700}.  The problem is so
difficult that the opening line of Holkner and Harland's paper on static analysis in
Python opens with ``The Python programming language is typical among dynamic languages in
that programs written in it are not susceptible to static
analysis.''\cite{Holkner:2009:EDB:1862659.1862665}  Dynamic languages such as Ruby provide
impressive programming power thanks to expressive language constructs and flexible typing.
Ruby, in particular, is strongly leveraged in the web development ecosystems thanks to
well known and supported frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Sinatra.

Web application security is a particularly difficult area for a number of
reasons including the low-barrier to entry for new developers combined with the
high-demand for their services, the increasing complexity of the web-based
ecosystem, and the traditional languages and frameworks for web-development not
adopting a strong defensive stance as their default.  Ruby on Rails adopts the
``convention over configuration'' policy aimed at aiding developers of all
levels in building robust web applications with a minimum of configuration.  The
goal is for the framework to simply ``do the right thing'' by default, and more
sophisticated features and technologies are to be explicitly applied by
developers with those more advanced requirements and understanding.  Much of the
power in the Ruby on Rails framework stems for careful use of ``magic''
functions: dynamically generated functoins using Ruby's powerful metaprogramming
structures.  As a side effect many of the methods called by developers are not
available to a static analysis tool by simply examinging the code on disk.  We
are able to leverage the consistency of the language and framework to perform
static analysis on Ruby on Rails applications, and reason about their attack
surface.  This is done by analyzing the abstract syntax tree, and sometimes the
configuration (generally simply library versions) of the program
itself and by comparing it to a pre-compiled library of known security issues
exposed by the Ruby on Rails framework.

\section{Introduction}

Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework which provides an Model-View-Controller
architecture along with many ancillary tools to engineer complicated web
applications with a minimum of code as well as a minimum of exposed complexity.
The fundamental principal employed to reduce complexity is ``convention over
configuration'' meaning that standardized methods are used to achieve standard
functionality.  In many ways this philosophy resembles that of the Python
community and its ``There's only one way to do it'' philosophy.  The
advantage to such a philosophy is that one can successfully rely on the
conventions to expose large families of security vulnerabilities present in
modern web applications.  The Ruby on Rails Security Guide\cite{rails_security}
lists a comprehensive collection of general web application security
vulnerabilities, and a number of Rails specific vulnerabilities, and their
mitigations as provided for by the framework.  Justin Collins, the original
author of the Brakeman Scanner for Ruby on Rails applications exploited exactly
this convention-based approach, and these Rails specific issues, in designing
the scanner.

\section{Brakeman Scanner Architecture}

At a high-level the BrakemanScanner treats Ruby as an acceptable Lisp and uses
existing parsers to decompose the code into S-expressions\cite{sexp_for_rubyists}.  Each
s-expression can then be interrogated for its type, for example a function definition, a
collection of arguments, a Ruby block, a function call, or a string interpolation.  These
basic building blocks forming an abstract syntax tree are the fundamental objects used by
Brakeman, along with its knowledge of Rails conventions, to analyze a given Rails
application for potential security vulnerabilities.

Moreover, some basic ``taint flow analysis'' can be performed based on the conventions
within Rails.  The means by which user-input enters the system is fairly consistent with
three of the major sources being the cookie collection, a parameters hash available in, an
used as the main source of input to, controller actions, and the request object which
wraps up the context of a given request to the application.  Due to the consistency of the
sources we may reason concisely about the danger presented by relying upon input from
those sources directly in contexts which have any potential security implications.

\section{Insecure User Input}

The standard adage of ``never trust user(-controlled) input'' is easily
proffered but one of the fundamental realities of developing applications
is that we \emph{must} act upon their data in some way.  As such it is key to
limit the ways in which we trust user-controlled data rather than simply
attempting to avoid the problem.

\subsection{SQLi Detection}

SQL Injection (SQLi), along with cross site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery
(CSRF), represent the most well-known and common, language independent, web vulnerability
classes.  Ruby on Rails, like any other web framework can be made susceptible to such
flaws though it does provide a number of mitigations and best practices to prevent them.
Moreover, many of the methods which automatically generate SQL are not explicitly defined
by either Ruby on Rails itself or by the user, but rather are automatically generated at
runtime by Rails.  The generation of these methods is based on interrogation of the
database which backs a given model wherein each column in the database is mapped to an
attribute of the model via the Object Relational Model (ORM).  Thus for a given user model
with two database columns ``name'' and ``email'' the User class itself responds to a
variety of methods, some explitly defined such as \texttt{User.all}, which returns all
users in the system, and dynamic methods based on its attributes such as
\texttt{User.find\_by\_name}, \texttt{User.find\_by\_email},
\texttt{User.find\_by\_name\_and\_email}, and even
\texttt{User.find\_all\_by\_name\_and\_email}.  While using these finders generates
appropriate SQL automatically, and the parameters themselves are correctly isolated, this
is a perfect example of Rails conventions that are so consistent they can be trivially
identified in a static analysis context.

A naive approach one might takes is to identify these finders is with a simple regular
expression of the form \texttt{/\\.find(\_all)?\_by\_(?:[\\w\_]+)(?:\_and\_[\\w\_]+)+(/}.
Brakeman opts to use the AST from a Ruby parser as it provides a deeper view into the
application, but the above would work quickly for a given model.  This consistent,
convention based, dynamic function generation is easily and deterministically identified
allowing for further reasoning about the functionality of the code.

Compounding slightly the complexity of isolating SQLi is that the parameters to various
finders may very well contain user controlled data, in this case passed in via a
parameters hash(-table).  Thus a simple, incorrect and explicitly recommended against
\cite{rails_security}, idiom for dynamically
finding a user by name would be \texttt{User.where(``name = \#\{params[user\_name]\}''}.
During the process of analysis we are able to reason simply about the
potential safety of such an expression.  The call signature of the
\texttt{where} method on an active record model only has a few different
permutations.  In the case where the first variable is a string it is to be
interpreted as ``raw'' SQL.  By examining the s-expression of the first
parameter we can quickly determine if \emph{any} (potentially user-controller)
variable is interpolated, and if so it is flagged as potentially dangerous.  In
the case where the user cannot control the data the flagged expression may not
be exploitable but is still an indication of an expression that should be
refactored to follow the best-practice of passing parameters to the ORM outside
of the query logic\cite{ruby_security_sqli}.

If a programmer attempts a ``clever'', independent re-implementation of such
dynamic finders as described above it is fundamentally more difficult to reason
about the safety of a given expression as there are no well understood and
accepted conventions about call signatures and handling as have been created
during the development of the Ruby on Rails framework.  Those conventions alone
allow us to reason concretely about the safety of a given expression.

\subsection{Insecure Redirect and Rendering}

A common idiom for concluding a controller action in a ruby on rails application
is to set some sort of notification to be displayed to the user then a specific
destination is specified.  This redirection to the specified destination, which is
specified by an options hash, must not be user-controlled.  If the user does control the
parameters to the redirect call then they may manipulate the \texttt{host} attribute,
which can be used to send a user, after completing the initial action, to a remote
malicious host\cite{OWASP_redirect}.  The user will likely trust a given link to a trusted
site without realizing the host manipulation is occurring. To increase the confidence of
the victim, the attacker may obfuscate the vulnerability by making the site to which they
redirect them look identical to the trusted site if they control the destination.
Identification of such manipulation at runtime is simply done by identifying any variable
parameters to the redirect.  In that case the redirect is flagged as vulnerable.  The
Rails framework provides mitigations for such redirection via the \texttt{only\_path}
option, which can be easily applied by a developer upon being alerted to the
vulnerability.

Similarly, allowing a user to control the view or template to be rendered in a given
action may result in an information leak about the system by effectively bypassing any
authorization systems in-place in the system.  Rendering within Rails is done via the
\texttt{render}\cite{render_method} method, which expects to receive the name of a partial
as a string and an options hash.  The path to the rendered view template should never
contain user-controlled parameters to avoid this vulnerability.  Validating that it does
not simply means checking for string interpolation in the first parameter, and checking
for its source.  If the source is the cookie collection, the parameters hash as created by
Rails, or the request object then the source is deemed to be tainted and is flagged.  Much
like the taint-safety of Perl, once a variable from one of those sources has been
manipulated by the developer it is deemed untainted and can no longer be reasoned about.

\section{Explicit Access Controls via Exposed APIs and DSLs}

\subsection{Mass Assignment}

After the well publicized compromise of Github by Egor Homokov\cite{egor}, the subject of
Mass Assignment vulnerabilities within the Rails framework came, once again, to the fore.
This vulnerability had been well understood within the community, and as such standardized
mitigations had been created and well documented.  The mitigations themselves were active
mitigations requiring understanding of the domain models to implement.  The goal was to
make such mitigations simple enough they could be implemented quite quickly with
fundamental understanding of the models and the use of their attribtues.  With the Rails
3.2.6 release mass-assignment was disabled in development in such a way that an exception
is thrown if mass-assignment restrictions are violated at runtime as an aid to developers.
The vulnerability is triggered via the very convenient \texttt{update\_attributes} which
is provided to update multiple attributes, including ``nested-attributes'' (those
attributes belonging to domain models associated with the model being updated explicitly),
via a single method call.  This update is done without regard to the nature of those
attributes as Rails does not attempt to reason about the use of any attribute.  For
example, a user may have a boolean attribute to indicate the user is an administrator.
Other attributes may be explicitly exposed to the user through a web-form such as ``real
name'' and ``home town''. In this case the user themselves might manipulate that web-form
fields to include an administrator attribute of their own, as if it were provided by the
developer, effectively making themselves an administrator.

While current static analysis tools cannot prevent the above scenario, as they
cannot reason about the relative sensitivity of various fields within the system
(though this might be accomplished with taint-flow analysis), they can reveal
those models which lack explicit white or black listing of attribute for
update.  Rails provides two mechanisms for attribute access control: white
listing via \texttt{attr\_accessible} and black-listing, the considerably less
preferable route, via \texttt{attr\_protected}.  The latter mechanism is often used in
``kitchen-sink'' models which have so many attributes that explicitly
white-listing those attributes which should be writeable is tedious for the
developer, so a black-listing of sensitive attributes is provided.  The
\texttt{attr\_accessible} and \texttt{attr\_protected} ``keywords'' are actually methods
in a sophisticated DSL, calls to which we might identify to infer that the
developers in question have simply made a determination about which attributes
may be sensitive and which are not.  Though this is not a bullet-proof
methodology it does draw a developer or external auditor to those methods which
have not explicitly made public declarations about the sensitivity of the
underlying attributes of a given model.  Moreover, those models which are
of sufficient complexity to warrant a black-listing via \texttt{attr\_protected}
may warrant a significant re-factor into smaller models, each of which can have
explicit access controls applied to them.  In this case, the mere requirement of
a given model being called indicated a ``pain-point'' within the architecture of
a web application which requires further refactoring.

\section{External library conventions}

Not only does the Rails framework itself encourage standardization in the
methods by which various pieces of functionality are achieved, but the entire
ecosystem has evolved with the same philosophy in mind.  Some libraries and
executable gems have become so pervasive as to be considered an integral part of
developing a modern Rails application.

\subsection{Bundler}

With the introduction of the Bundler gem the process of creating, updating, and
maintaining library dependencies for Rails applications, a process which had
previously been notoriously difficult, has become trivial.  Bundler interrogates
a \texttt{Gemfile} and determines which versions of gem, and each of its
dependencies (recursively) are required.  For example an application may require
a gem by name, by name and explicit version (useful for specifying a bug-fix
level of a gem), or an optimistic version which will never be less than the
specified version, but will choose minor versions up to the next major version
of an application to avoid API changes that may be introduced into a well
semantically-versioned gem.  The results of the dependency resolution process
are stored in a Gemfile.lock which can be interrogated for specific
vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Extension of Rails by Domain Specific Languages}

Much of Rails which appears at first glance to be made of ``keywords'' as a
developer might be experienced with from other languages is actually a function
call within the current class (or one of its ancestors).  Examples of this are
the \texttt{private}\cite{private_method} ``keyword'' for marking methods as inaccessible to call
from outside of the current class, and \texttt{attr\_accessible} and
\texttt{attr\_protected}.  Thus writing specific handlers to analyze the
parameters to these apparent keywords is no different than writing handlers for
an other function call.  Moreover this means that extension for gems which
introduce DSL methods of their own is of the same difficulty as implementing
handlers for the attribute control methods.  For example the MetaWhere gem by
Ernie Miller, which exposes some attribute-level searching of ActiveRecord
models provides the \texttt{assoc\_searchable} and \texttt{assoc\_unsearchable}
methods to white and blacklist attribute in much the same fashion as Rails
attribute access methods.
